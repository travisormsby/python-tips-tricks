    "That works, but it has two problems. The first is that you have to remember to write `f.close()` at the end or else the file will stay open. That increases the risk of file corruption. That's not too hard in this example, but the more code between the `open` function and the `close` method, the more likely it is that you will forget.\n",

    "Because it is common to need some setup and/or teardown code when working with certain objects, Python has context managers that allow you to apply that code automatically. For example, `TextIOWrapper` objects created by opening text files have teardown code to close the file, so you don't have to invoke the `close` method yourself. Instead, you can use a `with` block to activate the context manager."
