# Introduction

If you're anything like us, most of what you know about Python you learned by trial and error. Most geospatial professionals don't have much formal training in computer science or software engineering. And that's fine because we're mostly not computer scientists or sofware developers. We don't have time to train in a whole new career just to write some automation scripts. But the downside of a practical education is that it can be easy to settle for suboptimal solutions because we're not aware of better practices that can improve the performance and readability of our code.

This session is designed to highlight some common code patterns that work OK, but for which a better approach exists.

* Use existing standard library capabilities instead of rolling your own solutions
* Use more unpacking and less bracket notation
* Use more tuples and sets and fewer lists
* Use try/except instead of conditionals for validation
* Use more iterators and fewer lists for loops
* Use more comprehensions and fewer loops (but don't go overboard)
* Use more doc strings and type hints for documentation
* Use more automated and less ad-hoc methods of testing
